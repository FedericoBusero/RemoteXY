# RemoteXY
Library for Arduino IDE of RemoteXY, the remote control app for graphical interfaces

Use the website http://remotexy.com/ to create your own management interface for your arduino with your smartphone or tablet. You can create different management interfaces. Use buttons, switches, sliders, joysticks (g-sensor) all colors and sizes in its interface. Next, you will be able to get the sample code for arduino to use your interface for control from a smartphone or tablet. You will not need to re-install the android app, as it will determine which interface you have downloaded the arduino.

RemoteXY is easy way to make and use a mobile graphical user interface for controller boards to control via smartphone or tablet. The system includes:
- Editor of mobile graphical interfaces for controller boards, located on the site www.remotexy.com
- Mobile app RemoteXY that allows to connect to the controller and control it via graphical interface. 

Distinctive features:
- The interface structure is stored in the controller. When connected, there is no interaction with servers to download the interface. The interface structure is downloaded to the mobile application from the controller.
- One mobile application can manage all your devices. The number of devices is not limited.

Connection between the controller and the mobile device using:
- Bluetooth (classic and BLE)
- WiFi client and access point;
- Ethernet by IP or URL;
- Internet from anywhere through the cloud server.

The source code generator have support next controllers:
- Arduino UNO, Arduino MEGA, Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Pro Mini, Arduino Nano, Arduino MICRO;
- WeMos D1, WeMos D1 R2, WeMos D1 mini;
- NodeMCU V2, NodeMCU V3;
- The AirBoard;
- ChipKIT UNO32, ChipKIT uC32, ChipKIT Max32;

Supported communication modules:
